# The following contains the list of PDB_chain structures used to generate predictions and associated targets for the JD membrane docking paper
# The input folder contains the original folder, with the PDBs used for generation of STID maps etc. (which are then used for docking)
# input also contains the mutated folder, which holds the crystal homologs mutated with Modeller to match the target structures
# It is these structures that have their minimum RMSD w.r.t. the target reported in Table S1 
# Note that mutation was not applicable for all cases (as not all were homologs), but we have provided all structures (including repeats) for completeness
#
# Please refer to Excel spreadsheet for sequence identity and minimum RMSD vs bound stat
# The target folder contains the bound PDB_chain in their known docked pose
#

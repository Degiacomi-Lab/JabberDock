In this folder you will find 8 files.

receptor.dx and ligand.dx are the density file representations of our proteins, the atomic structures for which are given by receptor.pdb and ligand.pdb.

These files are all centred on the origin. The density files contain a voxel spacing of 1 angstroem. 

receptor_points.npy and ligand_points.npy are the equivilent point files of the density maps in a numpy format (the top of the dx files contains information on the voxel spacing and size)

receptor_bound.pdb and ligand_bound.pdb represent the atomic structures of the bound form of the overall protein. In other words, these give the arrangement that we want to predict with receptor.pdb and ligand.pdb.
